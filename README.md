The majority of this code is shared with [upstream](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). Platform specific portions are under development.
Much of the platform shim from the original uBlock Safari version is still being used.

## Installation

Until relatively stable, this extension must be installed [manually](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari/tree/safari/dist#install).

Compatible with Safari 10, untested on older versions.

#### Note

To benefit from uBlock Origin's higher efficiency, it's advised that you don't use other inefficient blockers at the same time (such as AdBlock or Adblock Plus). uBlock₀ will do [as well or better](#blocking) than most popular ad blockers.

## Release History

See the [releases pages](https://github.com/el1t/uBlock-Safari/releases) for a history of releases and highlights for each release.

## Further Documentation
Visit the upstream [uBlock Origin wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki) for further documentation.

## About

[uBlock Origin's manifesto](MANIFESTO.md).

Free. Open source. For users by users. No donations sought.

Without the preset lists of filters, this extension is nothing. So if ever you
really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard
to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by
all for free.

You can contribute by helping translate uBlock₀ [on Crowdin](https://crowdin.net/project/ublock).
